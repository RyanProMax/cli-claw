# Feishu Message Reliability Control Plane

## Goal

- Start implementing P0 `RM-2026-04-25-01` one small reliability fix at a time.
- Prevent stale live Feishu WS messages from poisoning startup backfill dedupe, so restart-window messages can still be recovered and queued.

## Done when

- A regression test proves a stale live WS delivery before `ignoreMessagesBefore` does not suppress the same message when it is later recovered by startup backfill.
- `src/feishu.ts` only records inbound Feishu messages in the dedupe cache after the message passes the stale-window filter.
- `PLANS/ROADMAP.md` records the milestone progress.
- Validation and review gate pass.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

Objective:
- Fix stale WS dedupe poisoning startup backfill.

Allowed scope:
- `PLANS/ACTIVE.md`
- `PLANS/ROADMAP.md`
- `src/feishu.ts`
- `tests/feishu-connection.test.ts`

Validation:
- `npm test -- --run tests/feishu-connection.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `git diff --check`
- `./scripts/review.sh`
- Manual review against `RUNBOOKS/Review.md`

Status:
- done

Validation status:
- passed

Review status:
- passed

Risks / Notes / Handoff:
- This milestone intentionally handles only the first RM-2026-04-25-01 reliability defect; queue dead-letter, delivery/cursor commit, readiness gating, and observability stay in the roadmap.
- TDD red observed before the fix: `npm test -- --run tests/feishu-connection.test.ts` failed because `storeMessageDirect` was called 0 times for the stale-WS/backfill overlap case.
- Fix applied: `markSeen(messageId)` now runs only after the stale-window filter passes.
- Validation passed:
  - `npm test -- --run tests/feishu-connection.test.ts`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `./scripts/review.sh`
- Review gate passed against `RUNBOOKS/Review.md`:
  - Scope stayed within the allowed files.
  - Existing live-WS/backfill dedupe behavior remains covered by the adjacent overlap test.
  - No unrelated refactor or launch contract change was included.
- Runtime code changes affect the running Cli Claw service; after commit, use the documented safe restart path.

## Working Rules

- `PLANS/ACTIVE.md` is the local active copy and the single source of truth during execution.
- Only one milestone may be `in_progress` at a time.
- Do not expand scope implicitly; update the active plan before changing objective, scope, or validation.
- Validation failure and review failure both keep work inside the current milestone until fixed or explicitly blocked.
- Mark a milestone `done` only after both `Validation status` and `Review status` are `passed`.

## Handoff

Current milestone:
- Milestone 1

Current status:
- done

Changed files:
- `PLANS/ACTIVE.md`
- `PLANS/ROADMAP.md`
- `src/feishu.ts`
- `tests/feishu-connection.test.ts`

Last failure summary:
- Expected TDD red: stale live WS delivery marked the message id as seen before stale filtering, so startup backfill skipped the recoverable message.

Suspected cause:
- `src/feishu.ts` recorded message ids in the dedupe cache before applying `ignoreMessagesBefore`.

Next step:
- Continue RM-2026-04-25-01 with the next reliability slice: delivery/cursor commit coupling, queue dead-letter visibility, readiness gating, or backfill ownership coverage.
